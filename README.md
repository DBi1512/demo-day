Learning Finnish is not the easiest thing to do while working or studying at the same time. Motivating and efficient way to learn anytime anywhere is something that would be beneficial for foreigners living in Finland.

Finlary - Learning Finnish Vocabulary App was built for this purpose. We wanted to create a clean, simple and user-friendly app based on the UX and UI design that would suit for everyone who wants to learn Finnish. 

With Finlary, the user is able to search vocabulary and then listen and watch it in video to learn how the Finnish word is used in the context. Our database has 70 videos with subtitles from Yle Areena and for now, the app is only for Integrify studentsâ€™ own learning purposes because of the copyright issues with Yle.

The most important features we have in the app:

Listening the word from a video: Our data can be accessed worldwide based on our selection of Finnish videos that can be seen everywhere in the world.
The database of 2000 most frequent words: The goal is that by learning these words the user will be able to understand most of the spoken Finnish language.
Saving the vocabulary/sentences in a separate list to follow the learning progress.
Log in account feature: Keeps users synchronized with all of their devices whether they use mobile, tablet or desktop.

We used React for the frontend and Node.js, MongoDB, Firebase for the backend. All the technologies were new to us when we started the project so it was also a learning process for all the team members. As a team, we used Github to collaborate, divide tasks, and control the workflow. We had three weeks to make the project so we had daily scrum meetings to control the  work process and to stay in schedule.
